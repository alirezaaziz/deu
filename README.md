This is a free list of German channels for those who are learning German and want to watch channels with this language.
I am learning German and I felt the need to watch German channels instead of watching TV in my own language to strengthen my language faster. Since I would like to help other people who are on this path, I have prepared a list of German channels and I always try to update it so that other friends around the world can use it. Please continue reading this text until Let me explain what you need.
In order to be able to watch these channels, you first need to install the program needed to watch IPTV channels.
On Android phones as well as Android box devices, you can use a program called IPTV. Unfortunately, my phone is Android and I do not have access to the iOS operating system to suggest a suitable program, but by typing the word IPTV in the App Store, you can find and test a list of suitable programs.
After installing the program, you only need to enter the link that I provide to you.
